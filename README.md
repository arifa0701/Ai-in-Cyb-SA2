# Credit Card Fraud Detection  
**AI in Cybersecurity – SA2**

## Project Overview
This project implements a **machine learning–based fraud detection system** using a real-world credit card transactions dataset.  
The aim is to detect fraudulent transactions and compare the performance of two classification models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** provided by Kaggle.

- Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gpreda/credit-card-fraud-detection-predictive-models?select=creditcard.csv) 
- Size: ~150 MB  
- Records: 284,807 transactions  
- Features: 30 numerical features (V1–V28, Time, Amount)  
- Target variable:
  - "0" → Normal transaction  
  - "1" → Fraudulent transaction  

⚠️ **Note:**  
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.
